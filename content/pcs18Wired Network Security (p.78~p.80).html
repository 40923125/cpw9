<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
<p id="N105AA" lang="">In this module, we will discuss wired networks. We will focus on wired network security and how to access a network via Ethernet.</p>
<p id="N105AD" lang="">Wired networks are more secure than wireless networks because you can control specifically where the network access points are located. Wired networks, like wireless networks, support MAC filtering and static assignment of IP addresses. But, wired networks also allow you to disable unused ports and physically control access to the network due to the wiring location of the network jacks.</p>
<p id="N105B0" lang="">Here are four tactics to consider when securing a wired network:</p>
<p id="N105B3" lang="">1. Lock down the Internet router.</p>
<p id="N105B6" lang="">2. Control physical security.</p>
<p id="N105B9" lang="">3. Configure static vs. dynamic addressing.</p>
<p id="N105BC" lang="">4. Limit users by media access control (MAC) address.</p>
<p lang=""><strong>Lock Down Router</strong></p>
<div class="section" id="router">
<div class="sectionContain">
<p id="N105C9" lang="">There are several methods for locking down the Internet router. The more methods you use, the more secure the network will be. You can lock down the router by changing the default password to a strong password. You can also lock down the system by disabling wireless web access so only a directly connected computer can manage the device. You can disable remote management so the device cannot be accessed over the Internet. You can only allow access through the more secure hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS). Finally, you can disable universal plug-and-play.</p>
<p id="N105CC" lang="">Additionally, you should change the network access by changing the default IP address for the network. It’s also good practice to limit the number of addresses available through the dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP). You can change the default service set identifier SSID, and disable its broadcast so users must know what it is before connecting to it.</p>

<p id="N105D4" lang="">Screen displaying MAC filtering on an Internet router.</p>
<p lang=""><strong>Physical Security</strong></p>
<p lang="">The most obvious (and yet sometimes overlooked) concept of physical security is to keep networking equipment behind a locked door. You also need to be mindful of the physical security of your wired network. In smaller environments, it is commonplace to see network equipment such as the network router, switches or even servers out in the open. If keeping your equipment locked is not an option, an inexpensive camera setup might be a consideration.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="N105D9">
<div class="sectionContain">
<p id="N105E3" lang="">Wireless networks allow a person to connect from wherever there is a radio frequency signal. Wired networks, on the other hand, require the user to be located close to a network jack. Unused network jacks need to be secured either physically or through the switch software. This allows the network administrator to control the locations where users can access the network. Locations should be minimized to offices and secure locations. Network jacks should never be left in open areas, such as lobbies or waiting rooms. However, if they are present in those locations, a physical device such as an RJ-45 port-blocker can be inserted into the empty jack, preventing unauthorized usage by malicious users. Note that many RJ-45 port-blockers can be removed with tools that are easy to obtain, so technicians should keep in mind that while this security method is fairly effective against opportunistic attacks, it is not as effective against planned attacks. In a network using managed switches, port security can be configured through the software to shut down unused ports, or authentication can be used so that users must confirm they have a network account prior to gaining access to network services. A Windows domain server or an authentication protocol such as 802.1x are options, depending on the equipment.</p>
<p lang=""><strong>Static Vs. Dynamic Addressing</strong></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="N105E8">
<div class="sectionContain">
<p id="N105EF" lang="">Wired security can also be enhanced by choosing static versus dynamic IP addressing. By utilizing a static address, each client must manually be configured for the subnet, gateway, and DNS server, making this a more secure option for a wired network. Conversely, a dynamic scheme can be utilized, where addresses are automatically assigned using a DHCP server. While this eases setup through the use of automatic configuration, if a malicious user connects to the network, they are also automatically configured if other steps — such as MAC filtering or some type of user authentication — are not taken.</p>
<p id="N105F2" lang="">In a small office/home office (SOHO) network, manually configuring IP addresses might be of value, provided you have a fixed number of machines. However, with the ubiquity of cellular devices and other small personal computing devices accessing the network, it is difficult to manage static IPs and much less practical than using DHCP. When using DHCP in your networks, you can minimize the number of DHCP addresses available to prevent unwanted use of your network by malicious users. Further, most SOHO routers today include a guest network that will allow users access to only services you configure at the router (usually Internet but not LAN access).</p>
<p lang=""><strong>Media Access Control (MAC) Filtering</strong></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="mac_filtering">
<div class="sectionContain">
<p id="N105FF" lang=""><em class="italic" lang="">Note: Some of the text in this section is used under CC-BY license from the<span> </span></em><em class="italic" lang="">National Information Security and Geospatial Technologies Consortium (NISGTC).</em></p>
<p id="N10607" lang="">Just as in wireless networks, wired networks support MAC filtering. MAC filtering is another method of securing a network (both wired and wireless). MAC filtering relies on the layer 2 address of the network interface card (NIC). A MAC address is a 48-bit address individually assigned to each network interface card by the manufacturer, with the first 24 bits identifying the manufacturer and the last 24 bits identifying the specific individual network interface card. MAC filtering is configured at the router by creating a whitelist (allowed) or blacklist (denied) of specific MAC addresses. When setting up a network, it is best to let all approved devices connect to the router first (before enabling MAC filtering) so their MAC addresses will appear automatically in the list, and they don't have to be entered manually. Note that people are not identified by the MAC address; instead, it is their devices that are identified, so it is important that the devices remain secure through additional means. MAC filtering is part of a total security solution, not a solution in itself.</p>

<p id="N10610" lang="">Screen displaying MAC filtering on an Internet router.</p>
<p lang=""><strong>Network Access Via Ethernet</strong></p>
<p id="N105AC" lang="">To access a wired network, your computer will need a network interface card (NIC) with an RJ-45 connector. Most desktop computers come with an NIC built into the motherboard, and many laptops do as well. However, with wireless network access becoming increasingly common, some newer laptops forgo the wired NIC in favor of a wireless NIC in order to keep the laptop thinner and lighter. You also need a network cable (also called an Ethernet cable), and a way to connect to the network (router, switch, or hub).</p>
<p id="N105AF" lang="">Setting up a wired network connection is usually fairly easy — typically wired network connections are automatically created by the operating system once a network cable is plugged into the network interface card. As with wireless networks, wired networks often use dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) to configure the proper IP addresses.</p>
<p id="N105B2" lang="">To configure a wired network connection, click on the network icon in the system tray on the Windows desktop. This will launch a pop-up window that tells you the name of the network connection, and also provides a link to the Control Panel applet: the Windows Network and Sharing Center.</p>
<div class="imagewrap"><span class="image"><img alt="Image showing the bottom right portion of a Windows desktop, with the system tray and a pop-up window that gives the name of the current network connection.

There is a link to Open Network and Sharing Center."/></span>
<p id="N105BA" lang="">Network connection status from the system tray.</p>
</div>
<p id="N105BD" lang="">Clicking on Open Network and Sharing Center takes you to the Network and Sharing Center control panel, where you can set up a new network connection, configure homegroup and sharing options, or troubleshoot problems with the network connection.</p>
<div class="imagewrap"><span class="image"><img alt="Image showing the Network and Sharing Center control panel. There is a blue vertical pane on the left with several links. On the right are icons, text, and links to various configuration options." class="popimg" id="_i_1" onclick="loadImageFromPage(this);" src="https://oli.cmu.edu/repository/webcontent/d824e08a0a0001dc23651919041a0b35/PCS18/webcontent/PCS18/image4.png" title="Image showing the Network and Sharing Center control panel.

<p id="N105C5" lang="">Network and Sharing Center control panel.</p>
</div>
<p id="N105C8" lang="">To see details about the current network connection, click on Local Area Connection. This brings up a window that gives information on the status of the network connection. For example, in the image below, we can see that we have an IPv4 connection, we’ve been connected for about six minutes, and we have a speed of 100 Mbps.</p>
<div class="imagewrap"><span class="image"><img alt="Image showing the Local Area Connection Status window. There is a single tab at the top labeled General. Below is text and buttons labeled Details, Properties, Disable, and Diagnose.

<p id="N105D0" lang="">Local Area Connection Status window.</p>
</div>
<p id="N105D3" lang="">Clicking on the Details button provides even more information about the network connection. Here we can see that the network card is a Realtek PCIe card with a MAC address of 00:21:85:4D:14:22. We currently have an IP address of 192.168.1.33. Our router (which is serving as Default Gateway, DHCP Server, and DNS Server) is at 192.168.1.1.</p>

<p id="N105F4" lang="">Here we can see that our current connection is using DHCP because it is set to obtain an IP address and DNS server address automatically. If we want to change this to use a static IP address, we would click the radio button labeled “Use the following IP address” and enter our static IP address. When using a static IP address, we must also specify the subnet mask and default gateway we wish to use. The subnet mask is typically 255.255.255.0 for a home network, and the default gateway is the IP address for the router (in this case, 192.168.1.1).</p>
<p id="N105F7" lang="">Similarly, we can specify DNS server addresses if we wish, rather than obtaining DNS server addresses automatically from the router. To do so, we would click the radio button labeled “Use the following DNS server addresses” and enter the IP addresses for the primary (preferred) and secondary (alternate) DNS servers we would like to use.</p>
